## CapstoneProject-SuperStore
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project EDA

In this capstone project, sales data of over 4 years from a ficticious company called SuperStore was explored and analyzed for insights into which parts of the company could be improved to boost company sales and profit performances. 

In this EDA, I first analyzed sales, profit and quantity sold trends across the timespan of 4 years of the different category of products that the company sells. From there, I went on to look into each category of product to find out what are the trends of sub-category products and how each of them performed. Secondly, I looked at the demographic of the customer base to find out who the company's target audience is and what insights could be drawn from this information. Finally, the geographic demographic of customers was analyzed to see if there was a correlation between location of customers with the purchasing power or buying trends of the products sold.

For this project, I used BigQuery to check the dataset using SQL. This allowed me to view the entire dataset as a whole and preview it. From here, I used Python to clean and transform the data, including creating new temporary dataframes, standardizing the naming conventions of the dataset, removing null values etc. After the data had been properly cleaned and transformed, I proceeded with the EDA of the dataset and it can be found in the "Capstone Insights' file uploaded.

I also made use of Microsoft Excel to run through the dataset to double check my findings and made use of formulas and Pivot tables to analyze the dataset in this project.
